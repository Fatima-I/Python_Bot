The code automates the process of filling forms from a google sheet using python.
The link to the google sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ii3g9GzR8_X3ZWXuR7vGLbjWnUECwDFuQyOPFw9_khU/edit?gid=0#gid=0
The link to the form:

To run the program successfully, you first has to generate an Google Sheet API to access google sheet and then replace the credentials in credentials.json file,
because after making the API credentials public, API gets disable.
